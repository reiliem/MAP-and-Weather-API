# MAP-and-Weather-API
Sample project on how to use google maps and OpenWeather API's
  1. Place the css file on a css directory or update the directory location in the First Map.html file.
  2. These files are good to be used in your local computer, if uploading this file to a webserver you might change the api location by removing the http:// from the "weatherConditions.open('GET', 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=33076,us&APPID=<YOUR API key>&units=imperial', true);" by removing the http:// it will allow this file to work in either a secure or non-secure server.
